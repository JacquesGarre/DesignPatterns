# Design patterns implementation in PHP [WIP]

### Overview
This repository serves php implementation examples of "Gang of four" design patterns, inspired by Refactoring Guru (https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns)

### Project structure
In every design pattern folder, a **Client.php** class example demonstrates how to use the implementation, and the benefits of it.

**[Creational](https://github.com/JacquesGarre/DesignPatterns/tree/main/src/Creational)**
 - [FactoryMethod](https://github.com/JacquesGarre/DesignPatterns/tree/main/src/Creational/FactoryMethod)
	 - provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
 - [AbstractFactory](https://github.com/JacquesGarre/DesignPatterns/tree/main/src/Creational/AbstractFactory)
	 - provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

**[Structural](https://github.com/JacquesGarre/DesignPatterns/tree/main/src/Structural)**

**[Behavioral](https://github.com/JacquesGarre/DesignPatterns/tree/main/src/Behavioral)**
