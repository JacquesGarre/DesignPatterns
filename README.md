# Design patterns implementation in PHP

### Overview
This repository serves php implementations of every design pattern of the Gang of four, inspired by Refactoring Guru (https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns)

### Project structure

Three main folders representing the three main types of Design patterns (Creational, Structural and Behavioral).
In each of those main folders, you can find folders containing a php implementation example of each design pattern.
In each design pattern folder, you can finally find the related php code, and a **Client.php** class example, that demonstrates how to use the implementation, and the benefits of it.

### Arborescence


**[Creational](https://github.com/JacquesGarre/DesignPatterns/tree/main/src/Creational)**
 - [FactoryMethod](https://github.com/JacquesGarre/DesignPatterns/tree/main/src/Creational/FactoryMethod)
	 - provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
 - [AbstractFactory](https://github.com/JacquesGarre/DesignPatterns/tree/main/src/Creational/AbstractFactory)
	 - provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

**[Structural](https://github.com/JacquesGarre/DesignPatterns/tree/main/src/Structural)**

**[Behavioral](https://github.com/JacquesGarre/DesignPatterns/tree/main/src/Behavioral)**
